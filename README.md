# Tomato Media Center (Placeholder Name)

Tomato is a modern, extensible media center application for Android, built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It aims to provide a seamless experience for browsing and playing local media, as well as extending content sources through a plugin-like extension system.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Modern UI:** Built with Jetpack Compose and Material 3 for a clean and responsive user interface.
- **Media Playback:**
    - Robust video playback using `androidx.media3` (ExoPlayer).
    - Gesture controls for brightness, volume (TODO), and seeking.
    - Support for subtitle tracks and audio track selection.
    - Background playback with notification controls.
- **Casting:** Stream media to Google Cast compatible devices.
- **Local Library:** (Implicit, as foundation for movies/series) Scan and manage local media files.
- **Movie & Series Browsing:**
    - Discover popular and trending movies.
    - (Series browsing is foundational but not explicitly detailed for Home screen yet).
- **Search:** Find movies from your local library and (soon) from installed extensions.
- **Downloads:** Download media for offline viewing with background progress and management.
- **Bookmarks:** Save your favorite movies and series for quick access.
- **Settings:** Customize application appearance (themes), player behavior, and data management.
- **Extension System (Basic):**
    - Install and manage extensions (currently via sideloading APKs).
    - Extensions can provide new content sources (e.g., `MovieProviderExtension` for popular movies and search).
    - Real APK parsing for manifest details and class loading via `DexClassLoader`.
