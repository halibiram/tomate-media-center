# Tomato Installation Guide

This guide explains how to install the Tomato application on your Android device.

## Prerequisites

- An Android device (Phone, Tablet, TV) running Android version X.X or higher (specify version).
- Sufficient storage space.

## Installation Methods

### 1. From Google Play Store (Recommended)

- Open the Google Play Store app on your device.
- Search for "Tomato Media Center".
- Tap the "Install" button.
- Wait for the download and installation to complete.

### 2. From GitHub Releases (APK Sideloading)

If you prefer to install manually or are testing a specific version:

1.  **Download the APK:**
    - Go to the [Tomato GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/your-repo/tomato/releases).
    - Find the desired release version (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
    - Download the `app-release.apk` file (or a similarly named APK).
2.  **Enable "Install from Unknown Sources":**
    - On your Android device, go to Settings.
    - Navigate to "Apps" or "Security" (this varies by device and Android version).
    - Find the option to allow installations from "Unknown sources" or "Unknown apps". You might need to grant this permission to your file manager app or browser app from which you'll open the APK.
3.  **Install the APK:**
    - Open your file manager app and navigate to where you downloaded the APK.
    - Tap on the APK file (e.g., `app-release.apk`).
    - Follow the on-screen prompts to install the application.

## First Launch

- After installation, find the "Tomato" app icon in your app drawer or home screen.
- Tap to launch the application.
- (Optional: Mention any initial setup steps or permissions required on first launch).

## Updating the Application

- **From Google Play Store:** Updates will typically be automatic or prompt you through the Play Store.
- **Manual Update (APK):** Download the new APK from GitHub Releases and install it using the same sideloading method. It should install over the existing version.

## Troubleshooting Installation

- **"App not installed" error:**
    - Ensure "Install from Unknown Sources" is enabled.
    - Check if the downloaded APK is corrupted (try downloading again).
    - Make sure your device meets the minimum Android version requirement.
    - Free up storage space on your device.
- **"Parse error" / "Problem parsing the package":**
    - The APK might be corrupted or not compatible with your device's architecture.
