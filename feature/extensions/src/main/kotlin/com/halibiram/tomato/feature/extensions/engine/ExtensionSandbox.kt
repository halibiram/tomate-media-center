/**
 * Manages the environment in which extension code runs.
 * Its primary responsibilities include:
 * - Isolation: Preventing extensions from interfering with the host app or other extensions.
 *   This typically involves custom ClassLoaders, and potentially separate processes or sandboxed runtimes
 *   (though separate processes are very heavy for simple extensions).
 * - Security: Restricting what extensions can do (e.g., file system access, network access, API calls).
 *   This might involve a custom SecurityManager (deprecated but illustrative), or more modern capability-based security.
 * - Resource Management: Controlling an extension's access to resources (CPU, memory, etc.).
 *
 * This is a highly simplified placeholder. A robust sandbox is a major engineering effort.
